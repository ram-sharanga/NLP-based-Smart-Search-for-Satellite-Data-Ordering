Hello Rohit!
I'm a 3rd year engineering student. Presently I have committed to a ML project that intends to address the following Smart India Hackathon problem statement - "Automatic Road Extraction and alert generation for new roads" 

Brief - The expected solution is a software that has a GUI to allow users to specify the area of interest for road extraction and alerts generation. Output should be in the form of shapefiles with geographical references. It should make use of ISROâ€™s Boonidhi images. The alert should be sent to configured email ids.

Request - I have been strictly realistic in choosing the problem statements. This one is neither too difficult nor too easy. I'm a beginner and with minimal time at hand, cannot afford to tread the hit and trial way. Your help and guidance will be extremely valuable. Can we connect over linkedIn please? I have sent the invitation.

Thank you brother! Owe you one.
